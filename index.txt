44563-01 - Michael Baumli Introduction

Michael Baumli

I am current a junior working on my major in Computer Science with in interest in cybersecurity.  I am only a part time student working to graduate sometime next decade.  I am also involved with the Cyber Defense Club and the Association for Computing Machinery as well as the Maker Space special interest group.

I spend most of my time working at Kawasaki here in this town in the Information Systems department and have nearly twenty years of experience in the Information Systems field.  I have a wife and a ten year old step daughter at home who is showing interest in computer science as well.  I have been a native to this area for the majority of my life, growing up on a farm just a few miles outside of Maryville.  For entertainment purposes, I enjoy setting up LAN parties, and occasionally participate in martial arts.

My goals are to continue working in the cybersecurity field and work towards research as well as develop counter social engineering techniques for the work force.
