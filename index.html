    <h2>Past</h2>
        I spend most of my time working at Kawasaki here in this town in the Information Systems department and have nearly twenty years of experience in the Information Systems field.  I have a wife and a ten year old step daughter at home who is showing interest in computer science as well.  I have been a native to this area for the majority of my life, growing up on a farm just a few miles outside of Maryville.  For entertainment purposes, I enjoy setting up LAN parties, and occasionally participate in martial arts.
